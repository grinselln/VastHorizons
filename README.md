# Vast Horizons
My goal is to create a web app that effectively creates queues for public Animal Crossing: New Horizons island visiting outside of turnip buying / selling to establish a better feeling of community.

# Technologies (to be expanded upon)
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Twitter Bootstrap
* JQuery

# Goals for Main Beta Release Features
* (x) Discord authentication to login
* (x) Sessioning to persist needed user data and unlock restricted areas of the site
* (x) All users must input their own island identifying details upon account creation for accountability
* Two initial island hosting reasons (unique visitors and villagers crafting DIYs)
* Max island visitor and queue restrictions
* Queue kick if a visitor is not active in uncovering the host's dodo code
* Visitors can view clear host island restrictions (flower picking, tree shaking, etc)
* Wishlists for island hosts (fees are not allowed)
* Near real time updates for island queues
* Dedicated, unchanging, URLs for user hosted islands
* The ability to update the dodo code if the island crashes, or choose to no longer host
* Multi-option sorting and search for viewing hosted islands
* Discord web hook to see new hosted islands in real time

# Feedback
I'm always open to feedback code or feature wise.

Code wise, this is my first deep dive into Node, Express, and Mongo so I don't expect there will be no room for improvement.  I always aim to improve!  

Feature wise, you can document your gaming experience here in a survey I created: [Animal Crossing: New Horizons Online Play Experience Survey](https://forms.gle/UYcTkjB5gUfZ54rr9)
